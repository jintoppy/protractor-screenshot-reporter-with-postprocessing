# Built on top of Screenshot Reporter for Protractor with HTML Reports and Screenshots

This is built on top of Screenshot Reporter for Protractor https://github.com/swissmanu/protractor-screenshot-reporter

For documentation, please see the original repository


## Usage
The `protractor-screenshot-reporter-with-postprocessing` is available via npm:

```bash
$ npm install protractor-screenshot-reporter-with-postprocessing --save-dev
```

In your Protractor configuration file, register `protractor-screenshot-reporter-with-postprocessing` in Jasmine:

```javascript
var ScreenShotReporter = require('protractor-screenshot-reporter-with-postprocessing');

exports.config = {
   // your config here ...

   onPrepare: function() {
      // Add a screenshot reporter and store screenshots to `/tmp/screnshots`:
      jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new ScreenShotReporter({
         baseDirectory: '/tmp/screenshots'
      }));
   }
}
```

## Postprocess Meta Data

On running the task via grunt, screenshot reporter will be generating json and png files for each test. 

With this postprocessing, you will get a json which has all the metadata, and also an html page showing the results. 


![test report in html](testreporter.png "test report")

Please see the examples folder for a sample usage. 

For running the sample, do the following commands in the examples folder

```bash

$ npm install
$ grunt install
$ grunt test:e2e
```

After the test run, you can see that, a screenshots folder will be created with all the reports generated. 

Documentation for all options are available in the main repository (protractor-screenshot-reporter)
